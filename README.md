 ##intro 
  
  My name is Kyle Knowles. I have been practicing coding since 2019. I am just getting into the more advanced stages of coding.
  I am attempting to start my own career within software development soon, in which I hope to expand my collection of github projects. In the meantime, please enjoy the few projects I have. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.
  
  ##TheSpaceResort
  (https://github.com/kknowles90/HTML-and-CSS-Projects./tree/main/project)
  The Space Resort was my first HTML/CSS project attempt. I had some minor issues but overall it turned out great. 
  
  ##Academy
  (https://github.com/kknowles90/HTML-and-CSS-Projects./tree/main/bootstrap4_project)
  Academy Cinemas was my first attempt to start inplimenting bootsrap which enabled me to focus more on styling and adding design, rather than the code itself.
